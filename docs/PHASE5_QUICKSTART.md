# Phase 5: Advanced ML Features - Quick Start Guide

## 🎉 What's New

All advanced features have been added to Phase 5! You now have:

### ✨ New Features
1. **Data Augmentation** (`src/ml/augmentation.py`)
   - Random rotation (90/180/270°)
   - Random flip (horizontal/vertical)
   - Random brightness adjustment (±20%)
   - Random Gaussian noise

2. **TensorBoard Logging** (`src/ml/tensorboard_logger.py`)
   - Real-time training visualization
   - Automatic metrics logging
   - Prediction comparison plots
   - Model graph visualization

3. **Advanced Training Notebook** (`phase5d_advanced_training.ipynb`)
   - Complete production-ready pipeline
   - All features integrated
   - Step-by-step demonstrations

4. **Complete Test Suite** (`tests/test_ml.py`)
   - 19/19 tests passing ✅
   - Full coverage of ML modules

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install New Dependencies
```bash
pip install tensorboard
```
(Already added to `requirements.txt`)

### 2. Run Advanced Training Demo
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/phase5d_advanced_training.ipynb
```

This notebook demonstrates:
- ✅ Data augmentation setup
- ✅ Augmentation visualization
- ✅ TensorBoard logging
- ✅ Advanced training loop with all features

### 3. Monitor Training with TensorBoard
While training runs, open a new terminal:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=runs
```
Then open your browser to: http://localhost:6006

### 4. Verify Everything Works
```bash
pytest tests/test_ml.py -v
```
Should show: **19 passed** ✅

## 📊 What You Can Do Now

### Compare Training Methods
1. **Basic training** (phase5b): No augmentation
2. **Advanced training** (phase5d): With augmentation + TensorBoard

Compare their performance on the test set!

### Experiment with Augmentation
In `phase5d_advanced_training.ipynb`, try different augmentation parameters:
```python
train_transforms = get_training_transforms(
    rotation=True,
    flip=True,
    brightness=True,
    noise=True,
    rotation_p=0.7,      # Try different probabilities
    brightness_range=(0.7, 1.3),  # Try different ranges
)
```

### Monitor Training in Real-Time
TensorBoard shows:
- Loss curves (train vs validation)
- Learning rate schedule
- Sample predictions every N epochs
- Parameter histograms
- Model architecture graph

## 📁 New Files

### Python Modules
```

├── augmentation.py        (318 lines) - Data augmentation transforms
└── tensorboard_logger.py  (351 lines) - TensorBoard logging utilities
```

### Notebooks

└── phase5d_advanced_training.ipynb  (16 cells) - Advanced training demo
```

### Documentation
```

└── Phase5_ML_Implementation_Summary.md  - Complete technical summary
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Better Generalization
Data augmentation prevents overfitting and improves robustness to:
- Observation angles (rotation)
- Coordinate system orientation (flip)
- Exposure time variations (brightness)
- Observational noise (random noise)

### Real-Time Monitoring
TensorBoard lets you:
- Track training progress live
- Compare multiple experiments
- Detect issues early (overfitting, vanishing gradients)
- Save publication-quality plots

### Production Ready
The advanced training pipeline includes:
- ✅ Data augmentation
- ✅ Learning rate scheduling
- ✅ Early stopping
- ✅ Model checkpointing
- ✅ Gradient clipping
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## 💡 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run `phase5d_advanced_training.ipynb` to see everything in action
2. Open TensorBoard to monitor training
3. Compare results with/without augmentation

### Short Term
1. Generate larger dataset (100K samples) in `phase5a`
2. Train with augmentation on larger dataset
3. Evaluate final performance in `phase5c`
4. Tune hyperparameters using TensorBoard

### Advanced
1. Experiment with different augmentation strategies
2. Try alternative LR schedules (CosineAnnealing)
3. Implement ensemble methods
4. Add uncertainty quantification

## 🧪 Testing

All features are fully tested:
```bash
# Test augmentation module
pytest tests/test_ml.py::TestDatasetGeneration -v

# Test all ML features
pytest tests/test_ml.py -v
```

**Status: 19/19 tests passing** ✅

## 📚 Documentation

Full technical details in:
- `docs/Phase5_ML_Implementation_Summary.md` - Complete overview
- Each module has detailed docstrings
- Notebooks have markdown explanations

## 🎓 Code Examples

### Using Augmentation Directly
```python
from src.ml import get_training_transforms

# Get augmentation pipeline
transforms = get_training_transforms()

# Apply to image
augmented = transforms(original_image)
```

### Using TensorBoard Logger
```python
from src.ml import PINNLogger

# Create logger
logger = PINNLogger(log_dir='./runs', experiment_name='my_experiment')

# Log metrics
logger.log_training_metrics(
    epoch=0,
    train_losses={'total': 0.5, 'mse': 0.3},
    val_losses={'total': 0.6, 'mse': 0.4},
    learning_rate=1e-3
)

# Close when done
logger.close()
```
