## 📤 Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to **https://github.com/new**
2. **Repository name**: `gravitational-lensing-algorithm` (or your choice)
3. **Description**: `Advanced gravitational lensing analysis with ML, GR, and multi-plane modeling`
4. **Visibility**: 
   - ✅ **Public** (for ISEF showcase)
   - OR ⬜ Private (if you want to keep it private initially)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/gravitational-lensing-algorithm.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Example** (if your username is "johndoe"):
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/gravitational-lensing-algorithm.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see:
   - ✅ Professional README with badges
   - ✅ 184 files uploaded
   - ✅ All documentation visible
   - ✅ LICENSE file
   - ✅ .gitignore protecting sensitive files

- ![Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-1.28%2B-FF4B4B.svg)

### Add Screenshots

Create `docs/images/` folder and add:
- `banner.png` - Project hero image
- `demo1.png` - Synthetic generation
- `demo2.png` - Model inference
- `demo3.png` - Uncertainty visualization

Then update README:
```markdown
![Demo](docs/images/demo1.png)
```
