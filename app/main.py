⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE ⚠️

This file (app/main.py) has been DEPRECATED as of November 5, 2025.

The application has been refactored into a multi-page structure for better 
maintainability, security, and scalability.

NEW LAUNCH COMMAND:
    streamlit run app/Home.py

MIGRATION GUIDE:
- Old monolithic structure (3,142 lines): app/main.py ❌
- New multi-page structure: app/Home.py + app/pages/*.py ✅

WHY THIS CHANGE?
1. Better Code Organization: Each feature in its own file
2. Easier Maintenance: Smaller, focused modules
3. Team Collaboration: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
4. Performance: Streamlit loads only active pages
5. Security: Isolated page logic prevents cross-contamination

WHAT TO DO IF YOU SEE THIS MESSAGE:
If you're running:
    streamlit run app/main.py

Change to:
    streamlit run app/Home.py

If you have scripts or documentation referencing app/main.py, update them.

TIMELINE:
- Nov 5, 2025: Multi-page structure created, main.py deprecated
- Dec 1, 2025: main.py will be renamed to main_legacy.py
- Jan 1, 2026: main_legacy.py may be removed

For questions, see:
- README.md
- MONOLITH_REFACTOR_GUIDE.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

This file is kept for backward compatibility but SHOULD NOT BE USED.
All new development should use the multi-page structure.

# ⚠️ DEPRECATION WARNING

This entry point (`app/main.py`) has been **DEPRECATED**.

## Use Instead:
```bash
streamlit run app/Home.py
```

## Why?
The application has been refactored into a **multi-page structure** for:
- ✅ Better maintainability (smaller files)
- ✅ Improved security (isolated pages)
- ✅ Easier collaboration (multiple devs)
- ✅ Better performance (lazy loading)

## What to Do?
1. Stop the current Streamlit server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run: `streamlit run app/Home.py`
3. Update any scripts/bookmarks

See `MONOLITH_REFACTOR_GUIDE.md` for details.
